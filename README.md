# What it is?
Simple C# program to find list of string from list of files

# What it does?
It reads all the file from a folder named "**searchFolder**"
Then reads all the line from a text file named "**searchTexts.txt**"

It will find the files that has the search string and log them into the "**Results.txt**"
The found files will be copied to the folder "**Results**" and named "`{searchText}_in_{fileName}`"


Very simple and no magic. :P

# Why it's exist?
Just because I don't want to search thousands times manually after receiving a task that needs to search a numbers of email addresses from thousands of log files
