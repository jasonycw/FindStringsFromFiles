# What it is?
Simple C# program to find list of string from list of files

# What it does?
It reads all the file from a folder named "searchFolder"

Then reads all the line from a text file named "searchTexts.txt"

It will find the files that has the search string and log them into the "Results.txt"

The found files will be copied to the folder "Results" and named "{searchText}_ in_{fileName}"



Very simple and no magic. :P
